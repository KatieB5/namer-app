# namer_app

## Summary
As part of learning Dart and Flutter, I built a basic Flutter app that generates names from two concatenated words, e.g., "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". Users can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Get started
1. Follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to get started with Flutter
2. Clone this repo
3. cd into the folder and open VS Code (this is what I used, it's free and works on all major platforms; if you don't have it you can get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
4. Select your target device in VS Code (at the bottom right corner of VS Code, you'll find a button that shows the current target device. Click to change it.)
4. With the lib/main.dart file open, find the "play" button in the upper right-hand corner of VS Code's window, and click it to run the app in debug mode.
